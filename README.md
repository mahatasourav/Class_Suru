# Class_Suru Coaching Center 🏫

Class_Suru is a hybrid educational platform that combines offline coaching with modern online learning tools for students preparing for IIT-JEE, NEET, WBJEE, JENPAS, and board exams.

The platform includes:

🎓 Student Dashboard – manage courses, progress & exam results

This project demonstrates my real-world freelancing experience as a Frontend Developer (with minor Full-Stack contributions), where I contributed to building and optimizing the online learning platform.
